# pico-8
A repository of pico-8 projects I have worked on. Some of the listed files are below

## new
An empty new file that can be loaded in without needing to reboot

## breakout
A breakout clone based on the [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYND9uft5u_1YCkmXiMrPU7tiBG3hIKAZ) from [TeamworkCast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6sBpVHofXvPbtiRwnTG5wA).

## ray_test
A small testing util for the breakout game (not too useful in the end)
